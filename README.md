Description

An Easy-to-use JavaScript API that protects any email address you want to use in your website from spambots.

It works in any browser with JavaScript support, even old ones (including Internet Explorer 5.0), offers different security options (very configurable) and it is just 2.57 KiB minified. If you want, you can easily configure it to be used with many languages at the same time.

The behaviour can be configured easily through the main (and unique) object the script uses (read the instructions). But if you are lazy, although it would be less safe, you just need to include the .js file in your website and change the class name (or add to the current classes a new one) of the A elements containing the links to the emails (the class name should be "easpm123" by default).

Following the instructions and some guidelines (included inside the package), the email addresses should be human-understandable even when JavaScript is disabled.

If you are tired of being spammed, you should try this little script (with an email address which spambots don't know yet!).
